## Event Forwarding

![](/images/activity-event-forwarding.png)

The Event Forwarding report provides information on your app’s incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services. This is where you can verify how much data mParticle captured per event, and how much data was forwarded.  If multiple configurations are enabled for an integration, the data sent to each configuration will be shown separately. We recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards.

The report displays a daily summary of events, plus counts for each message type and event name, along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service.  By default a summary of data for a full day is shown, but you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data.

You may notice differences between an inbound data count and an outbound data count. There are several reasons these differences may occur. Here are some good questions to start with:

*  Did you enable/disable the service on the date in question?
*  Are you using data filters?
*  Is the message type not supported by the integration?
*  Have you chosen configuration or connection settings that exclude certain message types?

## User Insights

Once your first-party app data is available in mParticle, we enrich it with data from 3rd party data providers such as **Datalogix** to promote a deeper understanding of your app users. By appending 3rd party data to an app’s existing user data, mParticle allows app owners to discover:

* Who their most engaged users are, including demographics, brand preferences, interests & hobbies etc.
* What data points are common among the most valuable users in order to improve user acquisition and retention strategies
* Which brands app users are most loyal to in order to create sponsorship and cross-promotional opportunities
* How to improve scalability and performance of desired KPI’s

mParticle supports 3rd party data in the User Insights report and in your audience definitions.

### User Insights Report

![](/images/activity-user-insights.png)

The User Insights report will be updated daily using the last 30 days of app data.

The following categories of performance stats are shown in the report:

1. **Overlap** - This tells you the reach of a data segment within your current user base.
2. **Engagement Lift** -  mParticle has selected 3 common KPIs that represent how users interact with your app in general: Sessions Per User, Median Session Duration, and Average Revenue Per User.
3. **Goal Event Lift** - Other than the 3 general KPIs we’ve selected, you can pick up to five custom events that you deem important, such as in-app purchases, social shares,  account creation, etc.

Each row in the report is a segment, and it shows how many app users this segment reaches as well as lift percentage on various KPI metrics.  The top 5% are shown in green and the bottom 10% are shown in red.
