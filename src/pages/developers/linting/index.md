title: Linting Tools
---

At mParticle, we have developed tools to allow you to statically lint code against your data plan as you develop. This allows you to adhere to your company's data plan and ensures that high quality data is logged to your workspace. [Click here](/guides/data-master/) to learn more about Data Plans and Data Master.

## Setup

For all linters, you will need to download your data plan and have a file named `mp.config.json` (mParticle config file) at the root of your project. Inside of `mp.config.json`, reference the your data plan's file location. You can learn more about the mParticle config file [here](/developers/cli#mpconfig). The required key for your mParticle config file is `planningConfig`.

## iOS

Our iOS linter lints Swift code. An example is below:

![](/images/dataplanning/tools/swift-linting.gif)

#### 1. Setup prerequisites

> Swift Linter requires macOS Catalina (10.15), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and the mParticle [Command Line Interface](/developers/cli)

```sh
sudo npm install -g @mparticle/cli
```

#### 2. Install the linter

Download and install the latest Swift Linter `pkg` file from the repository's [releases](https://github.com/mParticle/mpswiftlint/releases) page.

#### 3. Specify your Data Plan

If you haven't already done so, download your data plan from the mParticle platform and save it to a file in your source repository. Reference this in the `mp.config.json`file to tell the linter where to find the data plan file:

> Note: the example below assumes you saved the downloaded file as `plan.json` in the root of your repository. If you used a different path or filename, adjust the `dataPlanVersion` field accordingly.

```
{
    "planningConfig": {
        "dataPlanVersionFile": "./plan.json"
    }
}
```

#### 4. Configure your Xcode project and SDK options

To allow linting to take place automatically each time you build, add a new `Run Script` Build Phase to your project.

In the source editor for the new phase, simply invoke the Swift linter binary: `/usr/local/bin/mpswiftlint`

Optionally, you may want to reorder the build step near the top and/or rename the build step to something that will be easier to spot in build logs (e.g. `mParticle Linter`).

Finally, if you have not already done so, you should specify your `dataPlanId` and `dataPlanVersion` in MParticleOptions at the time of SDK initialization:

```swift
let options = MParticleOptions(key: "REPLACE WITH APP KEY", secret:@"REPLACE WITH APP SECRET")
options.dataPlanId = "my-org-data-plan"
options.dataPlanVersion = 1 as NSNumber
MParticle.sharedInstance().start(with: options))
```

#### Using the linter

You are now ready to begin linting your code--simply build your project using Xcode and if the linter detects that your implementation doesn't match the data plan, messages will appear inline and in Xcode's issue navigator.

#### Data point implementation status

-   [x] Event names
-   [x] Event types
-   [ ] Event attributes

## Android

The Android SDK provides the ability to enforce your Data Plan via linting. It only runs in the build environment, so there is no chance that it affects the runtime behavior of the mParticle SDK.

> Android Linter requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and the mParticle [Command Line Interface](/developers/cli)

#### 1. Add the mParticle Gradle Plugin

The next step is to configure the mParticle Gradle Plugin. In your root `build.gradle` use the following code to add the plugin dependency to your buildscript:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath 'com.mparticle:android-plugin:5.14.9'
    }
}
```

Next, apply the plugin in your project-level `build.gradle`

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.mparticle'
```

#### 2) Configure the Plugin

Either configure the mParticle Plugin object

```groovy
mparticle {
    dataPlanVersionFile 'mp-dataplan.json'   //(required) filename or path
    resultsFile 'mp-dp-results.json'         //(optional) filename or path
    disabled false                           //(optional) defaults to "false"
    verbose false                            //{optional) defaults to "false"
}
```

_Or_

provide an `mp.config.json` config file in the project-level directory

```json
{
    "dataPlanVersionFile": "mp-dataplan.json",  //(required) filename or path
    "resultsFile": "mp-dp-results.json",        //(optional) filename or path
    "disabled": "false",                        //(optional) defaults to "false"
    "verbose": false                            //(optional) defaults to "false"
}
```

#### 3) Install the mParticle CLI tool

Install the [mParticle CLI](/developers/cli/).

```bash
./gradlew mpInstall
```

#### 4) Viewing results

> Note: Any changes to your dataplan are not applied until the Gradle Project Syncs

Validation Errors surface in multiple locations.

-   Individual Errors in the IDE as linting errors (red squiggly underlines), marking the offending code.
-   Written to your `resultsFile`, if you configured one in the mParticle plugin
-   Within the terminal, run `./gradlew lint`

#### Custom Lint Checks

This SDK contains a number of custom link checks. These are designed to make the development process simpler and more integrated.

If at any time, they become too intrusive, they can easily switch off by including the Lint ID in the following block of your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
android {
    lintOptions {
        disable {LINT_ISSUE_ID_1}, {LINT_ISSUE_ID_2}, {LINT_ISSUE_ID_3}...
    }
}
```

## Web

Our Web Linter lints JavaScript and TypeScript code.

![](/images/dataplanning/tools/web-linting.gif)

> mParticle's web linter requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

Our web linter is hosted on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mparticle/eslint-plugin) and is built on top of ESLint, a tool that is industry-standard for web development. It supports both JavaScript and TypeScript files. You'll need an `.eslintrc` file as part of your ESLint setup.

Since the web data planning linter is built on top of ESLint, it can be used within continuous integration systems to warn or even fail builds due to data quality issues.

To get started, ensure you have a data plan downloaded and referenced properly in your mParticle config file.

#### Javascript

#### 1. Install mParticle's eslint plugin:

```shell
    npm install --save-dev @mparticle/eslint-plugin
```

#### 2. Specify your Data Plan

If you haven't already done so, download your data plan from the mParticle platform and save it to a file in your source repository. Reference this in the `mp.config.json`file to tell the linter where to find the data plan file.

```
{
    "planningConfig": {
        "dataPlanVersionFile": "./plan.json"
    }
}
```

#### 3. Setup `.eslintrc` file

Inside your `.eslintrc` file, add `@mparticle/eslint-plugin` to the `plugins` array, and `plugin:@mparticle/data-planning` to the `extends` array:

```json
    {
      ...
      "plugins": ["@mparticle/eslint-plugin"],
      "extends": ["plugin:@mparticle/data-planning"],
      ...
    }
```

You may have to restart your IDE for changes to take effect. If you are using VSCode, you can quickly do this by hitting CMD + Shift + P, typing `reload`, and executing `Developer: Reload Window`. Each time you update your data plan, reloading the IDE will allow the new data points to be consumed by the linter.

After you've followed the steps above, you can test the linter against your data plan. Events that are unplanned will be underlined to note that they should be fixed, as in the example in the beginnig of this section

#### TypeScript

Since our plugin is built on ESLint's architecture, it also also works with TypeScript (.ts) files, though two additional steps are required:

1.  If you are self-hosting, include `declare module "@mparticle/web-sdk"` in your root folder's `index.d.ts` file.
2.  `npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/parser` and include `@typescript-eslint/parser` as your `parser` in your .eslintrc file:

```
{
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@mparticle/eslint-plugin"],
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@mparticle/data-planning"
  ]
}

```
