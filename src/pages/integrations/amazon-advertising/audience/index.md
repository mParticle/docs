[Amazon  Advertising](https://advertising.amazon.com/) provides ad solutions to help you find, attract, and engage millions of Amazon customers at every stage of their journey.

## Prerequisites 

To set up the mParticle integration with Amazon Advertising, use your Amazon Marketplace account credentials. These credentials are the same ones you use to log into the Amazon Seller Central. During the integration activation process in Audience Manager, the integration prompts you to log into your Amazon Advertising account, and once logged in, mParticle automatically retrieves the credentials that it needs to forward audience data to Amazon Advertising.

## User Identity Mapping

When forwarding audience data to Amazon Advertising, mParticle will send IDFAs and Google Advertising IDs.

## Upload Frequency

The Amazon Advertising Audience Integration uses Bulk Forwarding. Bulk Forwarding means that, instead of uploading updates to an audience in real time, mParticle compiles updates into a queue until either a given amount of time has passed since the last upload, or until a certain amount of data is ready to be sent.

By default, mParticle uploads to Amazon Advertising whenever at least one of the following conditions is met:

* 2 hours have passed since the last update
* Bulk queue size limit is reached

Upload frequency can sometimes be adjusted. Reach out to your mParticle Customer Success Manager if you need to discuss upload frequency.
