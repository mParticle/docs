Track purchases, signups and conversions from [Google Ads](https://ads.google.com/) and create [Customer Match](https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6379332?hl=en-GB&ref_topic=6296507) lists for targeting.

This integration utilizes Google's [Remarketing and Audience Targeting API](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/remarketing).

## Prerequisites

To set up the Google Ads Audience integration, you will need to have a working Ads account and know your Client Customer ID, which you can obtain from your Google Account Manager. Before you create the connection, you must make a request to your Google Account Manager to have your Client Customer ID whitelisted for the "Mobile Device IDs for Customer Match Beta".

When you add the integration from the Directory, sign into your Google Ads account, using your username and password, to give mParticle permission to upload user lists.

To send Device ID audiences you will need to provide a unique App ID of the apps for which you collected the ID data:
* For iOS, the App ID is the 9 digit string that appears at the end of an App Store URL
* For Android, the ID string is the application's package name

See [Google's Adwords appId reference](https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/reference/v201802/AdwordsUserListService.CrmBasedUserList#appid) for more on the App ID requirement.

## Supported Identity Types

### Email

Note that Google Ads can only make use of email addresses that are associated with a Google account, and only addresses ending in `@gmail.com` can be used for Gmail targeting lists. mParticle sends addresses to Google Ads as SHA-256 hashed values.

### Phone Numbers

For a Phone Number audience, mParticle forwards all 3 phone number identities as well as the `$Mobile` user attribute. mParticle sends phone numbers to Google Ads as SHA-256 hashed values.

### Device ID

For a Device ID audience, mParticle forwards the Apple Advertising Identifier (IDFA) or the Android Advertising ID (AAID). No other fields are included with Device ID audiences. If you choose to send either or both Device IDs you **MUST** provide the correct App ID for each type. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

## Data Processing Notes

* mParticle names User Lists in Google Ads based on the External Name of the audience and the identity type. For example, if you connect an audience named `Remarketing` to Ads and check all three identity types, mParticle will create four audiences called `Remarketing (Email)`, `Remarketing (Phone)`, `Remarketing (IDFA)`, and `Remarketing (AAID)`.
* Google Ads usually takes between 6 and 12 hours to populate a list with new members, although it can take longer, up to 48 hours. You are likely to see a status of 'In Progress' on lists that have been updated by mParticle in that time frame.
* For privacy purposes, Google Ads displays the membership size of a list as `0` if it is below 1000 and also rounds the size to two significant digits - i.e. `13540` becomes `13000`, so the numbers in your mParticle audience will not match your list size in Google Ads.
* Google Ads requires at least 5000 members to start serving ads to an audience.
