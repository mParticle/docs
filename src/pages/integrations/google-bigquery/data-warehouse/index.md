## How it works

Given that you are already sending data from your app(s) to mParticle, you can enable BigQuery in your project in Google Cloud Platform, and complete BigQuery configuration on the mParticle UI. Then your app data will be continuously streamed into BigQuery.

In general, mParticle back-end services will perform the following actions in your BigQuery dataset.

1. Store each app's data in a separate set of tables.
2. Create a table for each custom event name as well as each eCommerce event name that has occurred at least once in the last 30 days. All other message types (e.g., session start, session end, screen views, etc.) will be put into a single table called [Table Prefix]_"otherevents".
3. Stream data into each table accordingly. Loaded data should be available for analysis within a few seconds of streaming insertion into a table. 
4. Set expiration time on each table according to the data retention policy configured on the mParticle UI.

Note that mParticle begins loading current data into BigQuery from the time the integration is enabled. You can work with mParticle customer support team to load historical data.

## BigQuery Configuration

To load data, please complete the following steps.

1. Enable BigQuery in your project in Google Cloud Platform.
2. From the **IAM** page for your project, add `mparticle-gcp-clientfacing@gcp-prod-170221.iam.gserviceaccount.com` as a member with the BigQuery Job User and Project Viewer roles. 
    ![](/images/bigquery-project-viewer.jpg)
3. From the **BigQuery** page for your project:
    * Create a dataset to load your app into.
    * Click on **Share Dataset** on the dataset page.
      ![](/images/bigquery-share-dataset.jpg)
    * Add `mparticle-gcp-clientfacing@gcp-prod-170221.iam.gserviceaccount.com` with the BigQuery Data Editor and Project Viewer roles.  
      ![medium](/images/bigquery-permission.jpg)
4. Log into mParticle platform, and navigate to the BigQuery page. 

<aside class= "warning">
Note: In the mParticle app, if you do not have Admin rights, you will be able to see the <b>Settings</b> dialog but it will be set to "Read Only" and you will not be allowed to add any new Configurations. For permissions talk to your administrator for the appropriate access.
</aside>

* Enter your BigQuery `projectId` (note that it may be different from your project name) and the `datasetId` of the dataset created in step 3.

![](/images/bigquery-project-id.jpg)

* Enter your BigQuery table prefix
* Optionally, you may configure a data retention policy.
5. Connect individual inputs to the BigQuery output from the **Connections** page. You must connect every input you want to store data for.

### mParticle Setup

After adding Google BigQuery from the integrations Directory, you can find the settings UI at **Setup > Data Warehouse**.

![](/images/bigquery-setup.png)

From the main page for your Google BigQuery configuration, select the **Settings** tab to provide the necessary settings to get your Google BigQuery integration working.

To forward data subject erasure requests to Google BigQuery, set the Forwarding Status toggle to Active and select **I understand** after reading the disclaimer. Once the status has been set to Active, erasure requests are sent to Google BigQuery immediately upon being received by mParticle.

<aside>The forwarding behavior for data subject erasure requests to Google BigQuery is different than the behavior of other event integrations. With Google BigQuery, the forwarding status reported by mParticle also represents the fulfillment status of the request, since mParticle knows immediately if the erasure request was processed successfully or not.

### Connection Settings
| Setting Name | Data Type | Default Value | Platform | Description |
| ---|---|---|---|---|
| BigQuery Table Name | `string` | | Out of Band | Table name for this partner feed. If not set, the partner name will be used.  Only applicable to feeds inputs, no effect on apps inputs. If "Split Partner Feed Data by Event Name" checkbox is enabled, this setting is not used. |
| Split Partner Feed Data by Event Name | `boolean` | False | Out of Band | If enabled, split partner feed data by event name. Otherwise load data into the same table. |
| Send Batches without Events | `boolean` | True | All | If enabled, an event batch that contains no events will be forwarded. |

### Optional Steps

You can upload your own JSON BigQuery service account credentials using the **Google Service Account Key JSON (Optional)** field in the **Data Warehouse** > **Settings** page. If you do not provide your custom credentials, mParticle's Google service account credentials will used. The image below shows a sample JSON configuration file.

 ![](/images/bigquery-settings-custom-configuration052019.png)

<aside class= "warning">
Note: The `projectId` referenced in the **Google Service Account Key JSON** configuration file should match the `projectId` created in step 3.
</aside>


After successfully saving the configurations, data loading should start within a few minutes, and you can view the data load status on the mParticle BigQuery page.

## BigQuery Schema

All of your data is stored in one single BigQuery dataset. 

Each app has its own set of tables. Each table name has a table name prefix. This will be the name of your app, except for data from Feeds, for which you can customize the prefix in the Connection Settings.

By default, each custom event name and eCommerce event name have their own table in BigQuery dataset, and all other event names (e.g., session-start, session-end) are stored in a single table. The naming conversion of the table names are as follows.

- A custom event name will have a table named **[Table Prefix]\_event\_[event type]\_[event name]**. For example, a *Navigation* type event named *SignUp* from an app named "my cool app" will have a table named *mycoolapp_event_navigation_signup*.
- An eCommerce event name will have a table named **[Table Prefix]\_ecomm\_[event name]**.
- All other events are stored in a table named **[Table Prefix]\_otherevents**.

On top of what's mentioned above, data is stored by week and thus each table name has a date value as an appendix. The date value is the date of the Sunday of a week. For example, you'll see table names like **mycoolapp\_event\_navigation\_signup20160424**, **mycoolapp\_event\_navigation\_signup20160417**, **mycoolapp\_event\_navigation\_signup20160410**, etc.

Each table has the following fields.

## Partner Feed Data

Events from each connected Partner Feed will be stored under a single table unless the **Split Partner Feed Data by Event Name** checkbox is enabled. You can choose the table name for each Feed in the Connection Settings. If you do not provide a name, mParticle will use the name of the Partner.

![medium](/images/big-query-feed.png)

## Device Application Stamp Forwarding

Events can be forwarded with a Device Application Stamp stored in the device ID column. You can enable this in the settings page for your data warehouse configuration by toggling the **Store Device Stamp** checkbox.

## Best Practices

1. Query a specific table whenever possible. Doing this lowers your BigQuery bill since BigQuery charges by how much data is queried.
1. For the same reason as above, only include the fields you really want in a query whenever possible.
1. When counting number of distinct elements, BigQuery use estimation by HyperLogLog by default. To get an exact count, use "count(distinct fieldName, n)", which tells BigQuery to use estimation only if there are more than n number of unique elements.
1. When dealing with more than one repeated field, use [FLATTEN operator](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-reference#flatten). When using FLATTEN operator and [table wildcard functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/query-reference#tablewildcardfunctions) together, reference the following example:
    ~~~sql
    -- calculate daily signups from facebook US users
    SELECT
      DATE(EventTimestamp),
      COUNT(*)
    FROM
      FLATTEN((
        SELECT
          *
        FROM
          TABLE_QUERY([myproject:mydataset], 'table_id contains "mycoolapp"')), eventattributes)
    WHERE
      EventName = 'SignUp'
      AND EventAttributes.attributename = 'Sign Up Method'
      AND EventAttributes.attributevalue = 'Facebook'
      AND UserAttributes.attributename = 'Country'
      AND UserAttributes.attributevalue = 'US'
    GROUP BY 1
    ORDER BY 1
    ~~~
